Cubeedoo Prototype version 1.1.a
========

I was asked to design the interface and interaction of the game Cubeedoo (seen here: https://github.com/Cubeedoo/Cubeedoo), and this was the result of a quick weekend of work. It is still being actively developed, although now independently of the official Cubeedoo, as a personal playground for experimenting with techniques of modern, web app development. This will forever be a work-in-progress.

Current state:

	1. Login is fake
	2. No settings or accounts, so the respective buttons are non-functional
	3. The game is in working condition
	4. There is no scoring function
	5. There is no saved state or routing

Future needs:

	1. Convert to real mobile design and add responsiveness
	2. Add "Create Account" button
	3. Add scoring
	4. Add settings and account functionality
	5. Much more ...
